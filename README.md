## MicroArray Data

Microarray data is a kind of data where the number of attributes are more when compared to number of instances. This data deals with large number of numerical DNA or RNA sequences. As the number of row is less it is difficult to attain maximum accuracy. Due to the high dimensionality of this data the model will not be able to predict the output correctly. 

**Problems Faced**: <br>
1. Microarray data classification is a difficult challenge due to its high number of features and the small sample sizes.
2. Gene selection addresses many problems in microarray datasets such as reducing the number of irrelevant and noisy genes, and selecting the most related genes to improve the classification results.
